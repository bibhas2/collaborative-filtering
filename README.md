# Collaborative Filtering Using tensorflow

This is an implementation of NetFlix competition winning collaborative filtering as described in [here](https://datajobs.com/data-science-repo/Recommender-Systems-%5BNetflix%5D.pdf).

The work was greatly inspired by [this other implementation](https://github.com/arongdari/MatrixFactorization-TensorFlow).

We use MovieLens data for training.

Run the code as:

```
python model.py
```

With 2000 features for each user and movie we get excellent accuracy after a few minutes of training.
