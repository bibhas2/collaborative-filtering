# Collaborative Filtering Using tensorflow

This is an implementation of NetFlix competition winning collaborative filtering as described in [here](https://datajobs.com/data-science-repo/Recommender-Systems-%5BNetflix%5D.pdf).

The work was greatly inspired by [this other implementation](https://github.com/arongdari/MatrixFactorization-TensorFlow).
